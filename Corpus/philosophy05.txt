Third, adjust all your means to that end. Those who are not angry at the things they should be angry at are thought to be fools, and so are those who are not angry in the right way, at the right time, or with the right persons. When there is no middle class, and the poor greatly exceed in number, troubles arise, and the state soon comes to an end. I count him braver who overcomes his desires than him who conquers his enemies; for the hardest victory is over self. He who has never learned to obey cannot be a good commander. Today, see if you can stretch your heart and expand your love so that it touches not only those to whom you can give it easily, but also to those who need it so much. No great mind has ever existed without a touch of madness. Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom. Whatever we learn to do, we learn by actually doing it; men come to be builders, for instance, by building, and harp players by playing the harp. In the same way, by doing just acts we come to be just; by doing self-controlled acts, we come to be self-controlled ; and by doing brave acts, we become brave.
