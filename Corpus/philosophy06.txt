Courage is the mother of all virtues because without it, you cannot consistently perform the others. Teenagers these days are out of control. They eat like pigs, they are disrespectful of adults, they interrupt and contradict their parents, and they terrorize their teachers. Character is made by many acts; it may be lost by a single one. The man who is truly good and wise will bear with dignity whatever fortune sends, and will always make the best of his circumstances. Find the good. Seek the Unity. Ignore the divisions among us. The greatest of all pleasures is the pleasure of learning. The tyrant, who in order to hold his power, suppresses every superiority, does away with good men, forbids education and light, controls every movement of the citizens and, keeping them under a perpetual servitude, wants them to grow accustomed to baseness and cowardice, has his spies everywhere to listen to what is said in the meetings, and spreads dissension and calumny among the citizens and impoverishes them, is obliged to make war in order to keep his subjects occupied and impose on them permanent need of a chief. Poverty is the parent of revolution and crime. The hardest victory is the victory over self.
