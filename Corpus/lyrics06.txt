Lost individuals is all I see Grab the top spot like pardon my reach Woke up one day and it was all on me If it comes down, it's gon' fall on me Lotta 42 on the flights I'm takin' Long way down from the heights I'm chasin' Just touched down, I was lights out in Vegas Girls checkin' in 'cause my lifestyle dangerous Hard to tell people that I'm all out of favors Call me for songs or they call me for paper Turnin' off my phone for the night now, baby Pourin' out my soul and it might sound crazy Some of my niggas don't love me We should sit down before shit turns ugly We should sit down since you said things about me You should slide through and get your back broke Used to be involved with me with no emotion I was on the way to the next show You was on the phone and you were so open Heard you said you're over me, is that so? You don't ever filter girl and that's okay Coulda held on but you let it go Sayin' to yourself that it's better this way Funny thing is that you're going to need me and I know You should slide through and get your back broke
