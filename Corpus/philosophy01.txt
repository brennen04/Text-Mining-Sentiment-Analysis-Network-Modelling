All proofs rest on premises. Friends are an aid to the young, to guard them from error; to the elderly, to attend to their wants and to supplement their failing power of action; to those in the prime of life, to assist them to noble deeds. When you feel yourself lacking something, send your thoughts towards your Intimate and search for the Divinity that lives within you. When...we, as individuals, obey laws that direct us to behave for the welfare of the community as a whole, we are indirectly helping to promote the pursuit of happiness by our fellow human beings. Education is an ornament in prosperity and a refuge in adversity. Business or toil is merely utilitarian. It is necessary but does not enrich or ennoble a human life. Why is it that all men who are outstanding in philosophy, poetry or the arts are melancholic? Goodness is to do good to the deserving and love the good and hate the wicked, and not to be eager to inflict punishment or take vengeance, but to be gracious and kindly and forgiving. For though we love both the truth and our friends, piety requires us to honor the truth first. The family is the association established by nature for the supply of men's everyday wants. Self-sufficiency is both a good and an absolute good. Liars when they speak the truth are not believed. Happiness involves engagement in activities that promote one's highest potentials.
