Dressed in fatigues, I rep the East with my trustees Smokin' on crushed leaves They turn they back on everything we built, then they must bleed I've seen splatter hit the snow when the blood freeze Straps over territory they know we must keep Get home and white Air Forces get brushed clean Back when my mama would interrupt sleep To tell me hurry up 'cause the bus leaves Summertime heatwaves, I used to just cut sleeves My shorty really love me, man, she want me to cut keys I can't do that normal type of life, is it just me? steady try to ride the wave, but it's rough seas I'm losin' enough sleep dealin' with envy And the news that they sent for me got the block in a frenzy It's on Meech like it's trendy Runnin' round from Laurier to MacKenzie when the city's empty, yeah Early twenties, but I want fifties, hundreds, not pennies I need plenty Got me ready to flip the F out like Fendi Whatever's in me, it's takin' over I gotta bust it down, break it open Until somebody starts takin' notice, then we rollin' Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin' Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in Now we rollin'
