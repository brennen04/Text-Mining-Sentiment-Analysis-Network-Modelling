- Really, really good rice, all the time. The service was meh. It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk. I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense. The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well. 2 times - Very Bad Customer Service ! The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well. Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good. There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company. Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up. walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating. The turkey and roast beef were bland. This place has it! The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old. I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try. The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying. All I have to say is the food was amazing!!! Omelets are to die for! Everything was fresh and delicious! In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.
