Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did. Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing. I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine. Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries. Service was fine and the waitress was friendly. The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten. We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night. Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES! Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that... Phenomenal food, service and ambiance. I wouldn't return. Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vegas. This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food. Penne vodka excellent! They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers. The management is rude. Delicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even. Great Subway, in fact it's so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations.
