It's like a really sexy party in your mouth, where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party. Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN! Best breakfast buffet!!! say bye bye to your tip lady! We'll never go again. Will be back again! Food arrived quickly! It was not good. On the up side, their cafe serves really good food. Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go! The only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming. Best Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it. I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious. This is one of the better buffets that I have been to. So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon! The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal! The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing. Will go back next trip out. Sooooo good!! REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good. At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn't that busy. This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit. Nice, spicy and tender. Good prices. Check it out. It was pretty gross! I've had better atmosphere.
