Education and morals will be found almost the whole that goes to make a good man. Experience has shown that it is difficult, if not impossible, for a populous state to be run by good laws. Wonder implies the desire to learn. Bad men are full of repentance. Every man should be responsible to others, nor should anyone be allowed to do just as he pleases; for where absolute freedom is allowed there is nothing to restrain the evil which is inherent in every man. But the principle of responsibility secures that which is the greatest good in states; the right persons rule and are prevented from doing wrong, and the people have their due. It is evident that this is the best kind of democracy, and why? because the people are drawn from a certain class. It was through the feeling of wonder that men now and at first began to philosophize. When you ask a dumb question, you get a smart answer. It is not once nor twice but times without number that the same ideas make their appearance in the world. The angry man wishes the object of his anger to suffer in return; hatred wishes its object not to exist. The duty of rhetoric is to deal with such matters as we deliberate upon without arts or systems to guide us, in the hearing of persons who cannot take in at a glance a complicated argument or follow a long chain of reasoning.
