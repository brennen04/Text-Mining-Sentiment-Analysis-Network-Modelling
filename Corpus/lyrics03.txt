Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react Been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at Please don't play that songs in this party, I can't even listen to that Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy Shawty, come sit on my lap, ayy, they sayin' Drizzy just snap Distance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap, ayy I've seen some niggas attack and don't end up makin' it back I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad What they had didn't last, damn, baby I'm in the trenches, relaxCan you not play that lil' boy in the club? 'Cause we do not listen to rats We in Atlanta, I buy her a wig, she tellin' me Tae is the best Point at the nigga who act like a killer, but you only one from the 'net I'm like DaBaby, I'm not just a rapper, you play with me, you gon' get stretched Ooh-oh
