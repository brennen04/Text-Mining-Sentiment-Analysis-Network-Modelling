Love me, save me, tell me, try me All you do is lie to me Takin' me for granted, I could tell All you do is lie to me Lies don't excite me, I'm lonely Need more than a homie Takin' me for granted, I could tell All you do is lie to me And dub me, you never love me Any confidence I came with, you take it from me I just wanna get beside you and make you love me I just can not take the silence, you keep ignorin' me See you makin' all this time for more important things We was s'posed to catch a vibe the other night Busy now, but you was down that other time Why you always lead me on and give me signs? I just wanna get beside and make you mine I just wanna come inside and reunite Got me waitin' outside (Hah) Uhm, you was just so in your pocket, uhm Cats used to tell me when they used to come to my house in Miami and shit That, that, that they felt a feelin' of like But, they was inspired 'cause they knew they, they, they had somethin' to see the dream for, you know? I done seen a lot of shit, I ain't never seen a, a young nigga as consistent as you that has affected the world in such a positive way since, you know, Michael Jackson
