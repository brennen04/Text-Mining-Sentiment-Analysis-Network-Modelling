Doubt is the beginning of wisdom. The most perfect political community is one in which the middle class is in control, and outnumbers both of the other classes. Humility is a flower which does not grow in everyone's garden. The best things are placed between extremes. Character is determined by choice, not opinion. Pleasure in the job puts perfection in the work. The worst thing about slavery is that the slaves eventually get to like it. We can't learn without pain. Think as the wise men think, but talk like the simple people do. We are what we repeatedly do... excellence, therefore, isn't just an act, but a habit and life isn't just a series of events, but an ongoing process of self-definition. Life cannot be lived, and understood, simultaneously. Excellence is an art won by training and habituation. The roots of education are bitter, but the fruit is sweet. Tyrants preserve themselves by sowing fear and mistrust among the citizens by means of spies, by distracting them with foreign wars, by eliminating men of spirit who might lead a revolution, by humbling the people, and making them incapable of decisive action. He who has overcome his fears will truly be free. The fool tells me his reason; the wise man persuades me with my own. Only an armed people can be truly free. Only an unarmed people can ever be enslaved. You will never do anything in this world without courage. It is the greatest quality of the mind next to honor. Masculine republics give way to feminine democracies, and feminine democracies give way to tyranny.
