I had a seriously solid breakfast here. This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas. He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas. My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions. Don't do it!!!! The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us. My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service. And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me. Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food. The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated. The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow. The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace. I give it 2 thumbs down We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us. My fianc   and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away. This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay. We waited for forty five minutes in vain. Crostini that came with the salad was stale. Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here! the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.
